                <p align="justify"><b>Volunteer Omaha</b> is a platform to connect students seeking volunteer opportunities with local organizations. Our goal is to make the process of finding volunteering opportunities simple. Omaha is full of students at all levels of education that want and need to volunteer, organizations of people that are passionate about helping others and many individuals and families in need. Our goal is to foster positive and lasting connections between organizations and the individuals that support them, so the Omaha community can work toward the causes its people are passionate about.</p>
                <p align="justify"><b>For students</b>, Volunteer Omaha aims to make volunteering easy and more meaningful. We believe in the importance of learning through serving others and that the desire to serve others grows through meaningful experiences. We hope to help students find organizations and causes to be passionate about and to build lasting relationships through community service. To this end, Volunteer Omaha plans to recognize those schools and individuals that volunteer most through this program.</p>
                <p align="justify"><b>For organizations</b>, Volunteer Omaha provides a connection to thousands of local students in need of volunteer opportunities. This platform also offers a method to track the number of volunteers and hours donated for each event and in total. In this way, Volunteer Omaha can help organizations reach needed volunteers and document activities.</p>
                <p align="justify"><b>Volunteer Omaha</b> was conceived by University of Nebraska Omaha student Erik Dodge with help from Shonna Dorsey. The website was built in 2014 by a class of UNO master's students led by Dr. Stacie Petter.
